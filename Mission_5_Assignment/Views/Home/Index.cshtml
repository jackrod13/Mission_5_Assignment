        I’ve always loved fly fishing. It’s a chance to get outside, relax, and enjoy nature. I especially like fishing for trout—rainbows,
        browns, and brook trout are my favorites—but I’m happy catching any species. For me, it’s not just about the fish;
        it’s about being out on the water and spending time in some of the most beautiful places.

        Some of my favorite fishing spots are Alaska, Yellowstone, the Uinta Mountains, and just about any river in Utah.
        I spend a lot of time on the Provo and Green Rivers, and they never disappoint. Every trip is a chance to make great memories and
        enjoy the outdoors. Fly fishing has become a big part of my life, and I’m always looking forward to the next trip.
